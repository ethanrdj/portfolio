        At the start of 2020, I decided to take the plunge and learn to code
        with Manchester Codes Academy. I was taught by real Software Engineers
        and learnt best practices in full-stack development. I found that I had
        a real passion for creating user interfaces with React and I am now
        eager to begin a career as a Frontend Developer. <br />
        <br></br>
        <strong>Some of the skills I learnt are listed below:</strong>
        <br />
        JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express.js, MySQL, MongoDB, Sass/Scss,
        HTML5, CSS3, TDD.
